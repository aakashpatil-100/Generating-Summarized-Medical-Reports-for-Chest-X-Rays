# Generating-Summarized-Medical-Reports-for-Chest-X-Rays
To create a summarized diagnosis report of a chest X-Ray image using deep neural networks
•	Built a web application to generate summarized medical reports for chest X-Rays
•	Used deep learning techniques like attention mechanism, LSTM, CNN, global flow and context flow
•	Accuracy evaluation was done using the BLEU Metric score
•	Achieved an accuracy of approximately 76%
•	Tech Stack: Tensorflow, Keras, Numpy, Pandas, Streamlit
